## Learning Objectives:
The learning objectives for the SQL week of "ML16" consists of getting the students to 1) be familiar with writing basic to complicated SQL queries and 2) understand how SQL can be used for the data pre-processing stage of ML Work. The slides and note for the course go over in detail the foundational clauses and concepts used in SQL. Along with explanation, we provide many examples as well as practice SQL Puzzles to ensure that the students are thoroughly exposed to the ideas and have as much access to practice problems as possible. We believe that, as SQL is a higher-level language, it is not a hard language to grasp, but being able to use it effectively and efficiently takes a lot of practice. As for the assignment, it's goal is to really challenge the students allowing them to explore questions that may be posed in industry. The puzzles in the assignment are difficult, but are meant to be so that the students get used to structuring and organizing larger and more complicated queries. The quiz is merely meant to be a sanity check and are more conceptual than anything as opposed to the assignment which is more so a series of rigorous SQL Puzzles. All in all, we believe our material allows the student to not only become extremely familiar with SQL, but also to understand the use cases of SQL in ML work.

## Navigation and Use:

**SQL Assingment** <br>
All files for the SQL assignment are enclosed in the SQL Assignment Folder. The folder can be downloaded, and all the jupyter notebook files can be run locally from the folder location.
* **SQL Assignment** - This is the student version of the assignment as a Jupyter Notebook. Students should have access to this file to complete the assingment.
* **SQL Assignment Solution** - This is the instructor version of the Jupyter Notebook assingment. Instructors can view the answers, which are filled out.
* **Political Tweets** - This file contains the database that the assignment uses.

**Quiz** <br>
The files for the quiz are available to download as PDFs.
* **SQL Quiz** - This is the student version of the quiz without answers.
* **SQL Quiz Solution** - This  is the instructor version of the quiz with answers.

**Slides** <br>
The slides are available to download as a PDF.
* **SQL Slides** - This is the presentation as slides, to go along with the SQL Notes.

**Notes** <br>
Extensive notes for SQL are available to donwload as a PDF.
